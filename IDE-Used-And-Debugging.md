IDE Used: For the first project, i originally started by using notepad to create the code.
Once i realised how hard it was to identify issues within the code, i then changed to an online IDE to help.
The online IDE i used was repl.it, the site allows you to type in code and it will help diagnose any mistakes or even syntax errors.
